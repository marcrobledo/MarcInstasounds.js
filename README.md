# MarcInstasounds.js
An implementation in HTML5 of the classic instant sounds buttons.

It's easily customizable, so you can add your own audio clips (and groups) just by following a simple file structure.
You can upload it anywhere or just copy it onto your mobile phone so you can use it offline.

Use the 'Record System Audio' feature in Skype and have fun with your friends during your calls!
